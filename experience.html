  <h1 class="title">Ryans Automotive Photography</h1>
  <h3 class="biggerbio">I have taken a few classes in the past to help me with my photography and editing endeavour. In high school, I took two seperate Graphic Design classes, which helped me become fluent in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I
    also took a Broadcast Journalism class in high school, which helped me behind the camera. In college, at OTC, I have taken another Graphic Design class, and plan on taking more. Next semester, in fact, I have signed up for Digital Photography.

          <p class="card-text">I started using Adobe Illustrator at the same time as Photoshop, and I am as comfortable with it as I am Photoshop, as well. Illustrator is more for drawing based creations, so it doesnt serve as much of a purpose for
            photo editing, but it can be used to create special scenes that could be drawn up.</p>
